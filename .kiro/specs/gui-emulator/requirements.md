# GUI Emulator Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a graphical user interface (GUI) for the 6502 Homebrew Emulator. The GUI will provide a visual debugging environment with real-time display of CPU registers, memory contents, disassembly, breakpoints, and execution control. The goal is to create a professional-grade debugging interface similar to modern IDEs and debuggers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Main Application Window

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a main application window that provides an integrated debugging environment, so that I can debug 6502 programs visually without using command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GUI application starts THEN the system SHALL display a main window with menu bar, toolbar, and multiple panels
2. WHEN the user loads a configuration file THEN the system SHALL initialize the emulator and update all GUI panels
3. WHEN the user resizes the window THEN the system SHALL maintain proper panel proportions and layout
4. WHEN the user closes the application THEN the system SHALL save window state and preferences

### Requirement 2: CPU Registers Panel

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see CPU registers in real-time, so that I can monitor the processor state during program execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the emulator is running THEN the system SHALL display current values of A, X, Y, SP, PC, and P registers
2. WHEN a register value changes THEN the system SHALL highlight the changed register with visual indication
3. WHEN the user clicks on a register THEN the system SHALL allow editing the register value
4. WHEN the user modifies a register THEN the system SHALL validate the input and update the emulator state
5. WHEN displaying the P register THEN the system SHALL show individual flag bits (N, V, B, D, I, Z, C) with visual indicators

### Requirement 3: Memory Viewer Panel

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view and edit memory contents in a hex editor format, so that I can inspect and modify program data and code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the memory viewer loads THEN the system SHALL display memory in hexadecimal format with ASCII representation
2. WHEN the user scrolls the memory view THEN the system SHALL load and display the requested memory range
3. WHEN the user clicks on a memory cell THEN the system SHALL allow editing the memory value
4. WHEN memory content changes during execution THEN the system SHALL highlight changed bytes
5. WHEN the user enters a memory address THEN the system SHALL navigate to that address
6. WHEN displaying memory THEN the system SHALL show 16 bytes per row with address labels

### Requirement 4: Disassembly Panel

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see disassembled 6502 code with the current execution point, so that I can follow program flow and understand what instructions are being executed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the disassembly panel loads THEN the system SHALL display 6502 assembly instructions with addresses and opcodes
2. WHEN the CPU executes an instruction THEN the system SHALL highlight the current instruction being executed
3. WHEN the user clicks on an instruction THEN the system SHALL allow setting/removing breakpoints
4. WHEN a breakpoint is set THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator (red dot) next to the instruction
5. WHEN the user double-clicks an address THEN the system SHALL navigate to that memory location
6. WHEN displaying instructions THEN the system SHALL show actual operand values (not templates)

### Requirement 5: Execution Control Panel

**User Story:** As a developer, I want execution control buttons and status display, so that I can control program execution and see the current emulator state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the control panel loads THEN the system SHALL display Run, Stop, Step, Reset buttons
2. WHEN the user clicks Run THEN the system SHALL start continuous execution and update the status
3. WHEN the user clicks Stop THEN the system SHALL halt execution and update all panels
4. WHEN the user clicks Step THEN the system SHALL execute one instruction and update displays
5. WHEN the user clicks Reset THEN the system SHALL reset the CPU and update all panels
6. WHEN execution state changes THEN the system SHALL display current state (Running, Stopped, Paused)
7. WHEN running THEN the system SHALL display execution statistics (cycles, instructions per second)

### Requirement 6: Breakpoints Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage breakpoints visually, so that I can control where program execution stops for debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sets a breakpoint THEN the system SHALL store the breakpoint and display it in the disassembly
2. WHEN execution hits a breakpoint THEN the system SHALL stop execution and highlight the breakpoint location
3. WHEN the user views breakpoints THEN the system SHALL display a list of all active breakpoints with addresses
4. WHEN the user removes a breakpoint THEN the system SHALL delete it from the emulator and update the display
5. WHEN the user clears all breakpoints THEN the system SHALL remove all breakpoints and update displays

### Requirement 7: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to load and manage emulator configurations through the GUI, so that I can easily switch between different system setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Load Configuration" THEN the system SHALL display a file dialog for JSON configuration files
2. WHEN a configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL initialize the emulator with the specified settings
3. WHEN configuration loading fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details
4. WHEN a configuration is active THEN the system SHALL display the configuration name and system details
5. WHEN the user wants to reload THEN the system SHALL provide a reload option that reinitializes the emulator

### Requirement 8: Real-time Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all GUI panels to update in real-time during execution, so that I can see live changes to the system state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the emulator is running THEN the system SHALL update all panels at regular intervals (60 FPS or configurable)
2. WHEN execution is stopped THEN the system SHALL immediately update all panels with current state
3. WHEN memory changes THEN the system SHALL highlight changed bytes in the memory viewer
4. WHEN registers change THEN the system SHALL highlight changed registers in the register panel
5. WHEN the PC changes THEN the system SHALL update the disassembly view to show the current instruction

### Requirement 9: Peripheral Status Display

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the status of peripherals (ACIA, VIA), so that I can debug I/O operations and peripheral interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN peripherals are configured THEN the system SHALL display a peripheral status panel
2. WHEN peripheral registers change THEN the system SHALL update the peripheral display
3. WHEN the user clicks on a peripheral register THEN the system SHALL allow viewing/editing the register
4. WHEN I/O operations occur THEN the system SHALL highlight the affected peripheral registers
5. WHEN displaying peripherals THEN the system SHALL show register names, addresses, and current values

### Requirement 10: Menu and Toolbar

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive menu system and toolbar, so that I can access all emulator functions efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a menu bar with File, Edit, Debug, View, Help menus
2. WHEN the user accesses File menu THEN the system SHALL provide Load Configuration, Exit options
3. WHEN the user accesses Debug menu THEN the system SHALL provide Run, Stop, Step, Reset, Breakpoints options
4. WHEN the user accesses View menu THEN the system SHALL provide panel visibility toggles and layout options
5. WHEN the user accesses Help menu THEN the system SHALL provide About and Help documentation
6. WHEN the toolbar loads THEN the system SHALL display quick access buttons for common operations
