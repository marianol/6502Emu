# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The 6502 CPU emulator currently has an incomplete instruction set implementation in its fallback mode. When the native addon is not available, the emulator falls back to a TypeScript implementation that only supports a limited subset of 6502 instructions. This causes programs using common instructions like AND, OR, EOR, and others to fail with "Unknown opcode" errors. The goal is to complete the instruction set implementation to provide full 6502 compatibility in fallback mode.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the 6502 emulator, I want all standard 6502 instructions to be supported in fallback mode, so that my programs can run correctly even when the native addon is unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the emulator encounters opcode 0x29 (AND immediate) THEN the system SHALL execute the AND operation with the immediate operand and set appropriate flags
2. WHEN the emulator encounters opcode 0x25 (AND zero page) THEN the system SHALL execute the AND operation with the zero page operand and set appropriate flags
3. WHEN the emulator encounters opcode 0x2D (AND absolute) THEN the system SHALL execute the AND operation with the absolute operand and set appropriate flags
4. WHEN any AND instruction is executed THEN the system SHALL update the Zero and Negative flags based on the result
5. WHEN any AND instruction is executed THEN the system SHALL store the result in the accumulator register

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the 6502 emulator, I want all logical operations (OR, EOR) to be supported, so that I can perform bitwise operations in my programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the emulator encounters ORA instructions (0x09, 0x05, 0x0D) THEN the system SHALL execute the OR operation and set appropriate flags
2. WHEN the emulator encounters EOR instructions (0x49, 0x45, 0x4D) THEN the system SHALL execute the XOR operation and set appropriate flags
3. WHEN any logical operation is executed THEN the system SHALL update the Zero and Negative flags based on the result

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the 6502 emulator, I want arithmetic operations (ADC, SBC) to be supported, so that I can perform mathematical calculations in my programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the emulator encounters ADC instructions (0x69, 0x65, 0x6D) THEN the system SHALL execute addition with carry and set appropriate flags
2. WHEN the emulator encounters SBC instructions (0xE9, 0xE5, 0xED) THEN the system SHALL execute subtraction with carry and set appropriate flags
3. WHEN arithmetic operations are executed THEN the system SHALL update Zero, Negative, Carry, and Overflow flags correctly
4. WHEN arithmetic operations cause overflow THEN the system SHALL set the Overflow flag appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the 6502 emulator, I want comparison operations (CMP, CPX, CPY) to be supported, so that I can implement conditional logic in my programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the emulator encounters CMP instructions (0xC9, 0xC5, 0xCD) THEN the system SHALL compare the accumulator with the operand and set flags
2. WHEN the emulator encounters CPX instructions (0xE0, 0xE4, 0xEC) THEN the system SHALL compare the X register with the operand and set flags
3. WHEN the emulator encounters CPY instructions (0xC0, 0xC4, 0xCC) THEN the system SHALL compare the Y register with the operand and set flags
4. WHEN comparison operations are executed THEN the system SHALL set Carry, Zero, and Negative flags based on the comparison result

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the 6502 emulator, I want register transfer and increment/decrement operations to be supported, so that I can manipulate register values efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the emulator encounters register transfer instructions (TAX, TAY, TXA, TYA, TSX, TXS) THEN the system SHALL transfer values between registers correctly
2. WHEN the emulator encounters increment instructions (INC, INX, INY) THEN the system SHALL increment the target and set appropriate flags
3. WHEN the emulator encounters decrement instructions (DEC, DEX, DEY) THEN the system SHALL decrement the target and set appropriate flags
4. WHEN register operations affect processor status THEN the system SHALL update Zero and Negative flags appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer using the 6502 emulator, I want shift and rotate operations to be supported, so that I can perform bit manipulation operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the emulator encounters ASL instructions (0x0A, 0x06, 0x0E) THEN the system SHALL perform arithmetic shift left and set flags
2. WHEN the emulator encounters LSR instructions (0x4A, 0x46, 0x4E) THEN the system SHALL perform logical shift right and set flags
3. WHEN the emulator encounters ROL instructions (0x2A, 0x26, 0x2E) THEN the system SHALL perform rotate left through carry and set flags
4. WHEN the emulator encounters ROR instructions (0x6A, 0x66, 0x6E) THEN the system SHALL perform rotate right through carry and set flags
5. WHEN shift/rotate operations are executed THEN the system SHALL update Carry, Zero, and Negative flags correctly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer using the 6502 emulator, I want branch instructions to be supported, so that I can implement conditional program flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the emulator encounters branch instructions (BCC, BCS, BEQ, BNE, BMI, BPL, BVC, BVS) THEN the system SHALL branch based on flag conditions
2. WHEN a branch condition is met THEN the system SHALL update the program counter to the target address
3. WHEN a branch condition is not met THEN the system SHALL continue to the next instruction
4. WHEN branch instructions cross page boundaries THEN the system SHALL consume additional cycles appropriately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer using the 6502 emulator, I want comprehensive test coverage for all implemented instructions, so that I can be confident the emulator behaves correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN instruction tests are run THEN the system SHALL verify correct operation for all addressing modes of each instruction
2. WHEN instruction tests are run THEN the system SHALL verify correct flag setting behavior for each instruction
3. WHEN instruction tests are run THEN the system SHALL verify correct cycle timing for each instruction
4. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN the system SHALL handle boundary conditions correctly (e.g., zero page wraparound, page boundary crossings)
