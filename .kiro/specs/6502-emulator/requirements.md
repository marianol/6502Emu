# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating an existing open-source 6502 processor emulator and customizing it to support a specific homebrew computer design. Rather than building a 6502 emulator from scratch, we will leverage proven emulation code and focus on implementing the unique hardware characteristics, memory mapping, and I/O systems of the target homebrew computer.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate an existing open-source 6502 emulator, so that I can focus on homebrew hardware-specific features rather than CPU emulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating 6502 emulators THEN the system SHALL identify suitable open-source options with good documentation
2. WHEN integrating the emulator THEN the system SHALL maintain the emulator's existing CPU instruction accuracy
3. WHEN the emulator is integrated THEN the system SHALL provide a clean interface for memory and I/O operations
4. WHEN testing the integration THEN the system SHALL verify that standard 6502 programs execute correctly
5. WHEN customizing the emulator THEN the system SHALL preserve the original emulator's licensing requirements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement custom memory mapping for my homebrew hardware, so that the emulator reflects my specific computer design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining memory layout THEN the system SHALL support configurable RAM, ROM, and I/O regions
2. WHEN accessing different memory regions THEN the system SHALL route requests to appropriate handlers (RAM, ROM, peripherals)
3. WHEN ROM is accessed THEN the system SHALL load firmware/BIOS from configurable image files
4. WHEN I/O memory is accessed THEN the system SHALL interface with simulated hardware components
5. WHEN memory configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support runtime reconfiguration for different homebrew variants

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to simulate my homebrew computer's specific hardware peripherals, so that software written for my system runs correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining peripherals THEN the system SHALL support configurable hardware components (68B50 ACIA, timers, GPIO, etc.)
2. WHEN peripherals are accessed THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic hardware behavior and timing
3. WHEN serial communication occurs THEN the system SHALL provide Motorola 68B50 ACIA simulation with configurable baud rates
4. WHEN timers are used THEN the system SHALL provide accurate timer/counter simulation
5. WHEN GPIO is accessed THEN the system SHALL simulate digital I/O pins with configurable behavior

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to load and execute programs designed for my homebrew computer, so that I can test software and firmware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading ROM images THEN the system SHALL support common formats (binary, Intel HEX, Motorola S-record)
2. WHEN starting execution THEN the system SHALL initialize according to homebrew computer's boot sequence
3. WHEN programs access hardware THEN the system SHALL route requests to appropriate peripheral simulations
4. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL provide system state and execution statistics
5. WHEN loading different software THEN the system SHALL support hot-swapping of ROM images

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want debugging and development tools, so that I can efficiently develop and troubleshoot software for my homebrew computer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide breakpoints, single-stepping, and memory inspection
2. WHEN analyzing execution THEN the system SHALL provide instruction tracing and cycle counting
3. WHEN examining hardware state THEN the system SHALL display peripheral registers and status
4. WHEN developing software THEN the system SHALL support symbol loading for source-level debugging
5. WHEN monitoring I/O THEN the system SHALL log peripheral interactions and timing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CC65 toolchain compatibility, so that I can use standard 6502 development tools with my homebrew computer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading CC65-compiled binaries THEN the system SHALL execute them correctly on the emulated hardware
2. WHEN using CC65 debug symbols THEN the system SHALL support symbol files for source-level debugging
3. WHEN CC65 runtime is used THEN the system SHALL provide compatible memory layout and startup code support
4. WHEN CC65 libraries access hardware THEN the system SHALL simulate the expected peripheral behavior
5. WHEN developing with CC65 THEN the system SHALL support common CC65 memory configurations and linking
